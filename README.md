# Squawkr Mobile

React Native client for the [Squawkr](https://github.com/kilowatt-/squawkr) project. Calls the exact same backend as the web client, and also shares (largely) the same Redux controller
with the web client.

I created this to teach myself React Native in preparation for my new job, and had a lot of fun with it!

### Work in Progress

- Improving detailed view UI - scaling images is a bit troublesome
- Implementing real-time updates (like on the web client)
